## SetLife Governance Engineering

Corporations are powerful vehicles of individual people that are organized around a common goal. The current model of corporate governance is largely centralized and operations are encumbered by traditional filing processes that could be automated. Startups and open-source projects have explored ways of automating governance and have leveraged new technology to introduce efficiencies to operational management.

This project aims to provide a minimum viable framework for automating and decentralizing the basic functions of governance among a number of individuals. 

#### Automatically Generated Corporate Documents
A CLI tool can be used to generate standard company documents for the purposes of compliance and record-keeping. Traditionally, a Secretary is responsible for documenting the minutes at all formal meetings and maintaining complete and accurate records of all company operations. This "Minutes Generator" could be used as a user-prompted scripting tool that generates these documents in markdown format and commits the file upon final confirmation.

#### Director Voting Decision Making
All disbursement of funds must be approved by a majority of directors and executed with a validated multisig transaction from the DAO wallet.
